            {"input": "I’ve heard a lot about quantum computing. It sounds really complicated, but also fascinating.", "output": "It definitely is complicated, but the potential it holds for fields like cryptography and medicine is huge. Have you read much about it?"}, 
            {"input": "A little. I know it works by using qubits instead of regular bits. The idea of superposition is really mind-blowing.", "output": "Exactly! Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, which could make certain computations exponentially faster."},
            {"input": "I can’t even imagine the possibilities that could come from it. The future is wild.", "output": "It really is! We’re just at the beginning of so many new technologies. The next decade should be very interesting."},
